# DU_Bootcamp_Homework_3

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

For this project, the main goal was to familiarize myself if base javascript coding. By creating this simple password generator program I used different methods from different objects to receive inputs from the user, and output the desired randomized password. Building this project helped me to practice working with vanilla jaavascript code, string manipulation, and for loops. This program helps the user not have to figure out a password on their own, and creates a password for them from the chosen criteria of characters to be used in the password. 


## Usage

To start, you click the generate password button; the page will then prompt you to input a password length from 8 characters to 128 characters. After you choose a number, the page will then ask the user 4 questions, specifying which character sets they would like to use in their password. The user will either confirm or cancel a specific character set, going through the 4 different sets of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. After all the prompts are finished the application will generate a password and display it within the text box on the main webpage.
